## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.



## First step

This step I create navbar using css code in the starter css file ,then I added the scroll behavior to html tag in css file to made scroll smooth when click on nav bar links. <br/>
<b>this list summarize the first step</b>
<ol>
  <li>add four li contains a tag to ul tag in html file</li>
  <li>add class <code>menu__link</code> to a tag thats child from <code>li</code></li>
  <li>Test</li>
</ol>

## Js Manipulation

In this step I will manipulate the sections in the page and when we look on the `index.html` we see this is the tree

```
BODY
    HEADER.page__header
    NAV.navbar__menu
        UL
            LI
                A.menu__link
            LI
                A.menu__link
            LI
                A.menu__link
            LI
                A.menu__link
    MAIN
        HEADER.main__hero
            H1
        SECTION.your-active-class
            DIV.landing__container
                H2
                P
                P
        SECTION
            DIV.landing__container
                H2
                P
                P
        SECTION
            DIV.landing__container
                H2
                P
                P
    FOOTER.page__footer
        P
```
as we see there is `HEADER` that will manipulate alone with `document.getElementsByClassName` and then add it to array that contain `section` objects that will manipulate with `document.querySelectorAll`.
